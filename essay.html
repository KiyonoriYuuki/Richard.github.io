Hello, Richard Here.

Listen, I know I kinda left unannounced and the situation that occurred came out of nowhere.

I've been through a lot in the past 6 months, and it's been hard.

But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn what it means to be in love.

I thought that love was something you just found. When the right person walks into your life everything would just be butterflies and rainbows.

But I know now that even though that is true to some extent the true meaning of love isn't something that you just find. It's something that you must constantly work towards each and every day. Nobody is perfect, but it's when you truly love someone that you make the conscious choice to choose that person everyday and build a strong foundation with them. Someone that you're willing to make sacrifices for each and every day simply because you want to be with them every day. Despite the ups and downs, the sickness and health, and all of the other wedding vows, you choose that person because that's the person that makes you happy at the end of the day.

Well needless to say I've made my decision.

And all I want now is to play my part in restoring the bonds lost not only with Katy but with the rest of you all. 

I'm truly sorry for what I did to Katy. Emotions can be a very dangerous and wild thing. However, it can also be beautiful and wonderful.

So as someone who reflected deeply within the last 6 months. I've learned to control these said emotions and learned more about myself so that I can not only be the best version of myself, but to also not hurt the people I care about unintentionally. 

I took this approach to writing an apology from Zuko when he was joining Team Avatar. I don't know why but I felt like his character development and apology was something that I could relate to and was the first thing I thought of when it came to writing this letter. Now to add onto this in a more serious manner.

Dear Barry, Mei, Samanda, and Austin,

I hope this letter finds you well. As per Katy's request, I am writing this letter to specifically address all of you guys.

Firstly, I would like to say that I am deeply sorry for how I handled my relationship with Katy. Breaking her heart not only hurt her feelings deeply but also forced me to cut ties with all of you, as mutual friends. I've been reflecting heavily over the last 6 months and I've realized that my actions were selfish and thoughtless. While this goes without saying, I really do mean it.

I failed not only as a boyfriend but also as a friend to each of you.you guys all have all been important parts of my life, despite how little we might have spoken to each other. I used to tell Katy this all the time but I feel like within the short time span that we've known eachother you guys have become closer friends to me than a lot of other people I know. I usually compare it to the friends I made by joining a fraternity but this applies in general. I've never felt so naturally drawn and attached to new people in a long time. You guys truly are amazing. I regret how my actions affected our friendships and that we had to cut ties as a result of my dumb actions. I understand that my behavior caused you to lose trust in me, but I am willing to put in the work to make that up to you all.

I've taken a long, hard look at myself and my actions, and while I do think I've grown tremendously as an individual, the work doesn't stop there and I will continue to improve on myself as a person. This experience has taught me a lot and I vow to set a higher standard for myself. Moving forward, I aim to be someone who respects and values the feelings of others and someone who you can trust and depend on.

I hope we can all hang out again and rebuild the bonds that were broken. I hope in the future we get to make a bunch of cool and fun memories. Even if you don’t trust me right now, I'm determined to use time to earn back that trust. My goal is not just to restore our previous friendship but to become even closer than we were before.

Barry and Austin, as the guys this letter is addressed to, I particularly look up to you as role models when it comes to taking care of the people you love. You guys have many great qualities that I can learn from and I will try to emulate them in my own way. This along with my personal growth ensures to me and hopefully to you all that I will never make the same mistakes again.

Writing this letter is just the first step in making amends. I plan to follow through with actions that show my commitment to change. I hope you’ll give me the chance to prove myself to you all and show that I really mean business. 

Because from now on I'm standing on business.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to the chance to make things right. I don't usually write letters (I'm a CS Major) but for you guys it's worth it.

Sincerely,

Richard

P.S. I know you guys wanted an essay but I think taking the time to code two whole website pages have to count for something right? Maybe some extra credit? :D
